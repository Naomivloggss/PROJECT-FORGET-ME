  <h1>PROJECT FORGET ME – EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Initiated:</strong> ██/██/████</p>
  <p><strong>Lead Investigator:</strong> Dr. Rodriguez</p>
  
  <p>Project Forget Me is a classified research initiative designed to explore the effects of controlled memory suppression, psychological isolation, and behavioral conditioning on human subjects. The experiment's primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of modifying and controlling subject behavior by artificially erasing or altering memories while imposing strict environmental constraints.</p>
  
  <p>Subjects are monitored continuously within isolated environments, subjected to sensory manipulation, and provided with staged stimuli intended to induce memory lapses and fragmented cognition. The ultimate goal is to develop reliable methods for controlling individual autonomy, effectively dictating life choices by controlling what is remembered and what is forgotten.</p>
  
  <p>Such control allows for “playing house” with real humans—carefully guiding and resetting social dynamics and personal histories to produce predictable and manageable behaviors, thus offering unprecedented influence over subject lives. This project seeks to extend beyond theoretical research, aiming to apply findings in broader social engineering contexts.</p>
  
  <p>The ethical ramifications are deeply classified, and subject welfare is managed under strict protocols designed to balance experimental integrity with minimal physical harm. Psychological trauma and dissociative symptoms are anticipated and closely documented.</p>
