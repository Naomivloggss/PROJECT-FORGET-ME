  <h1>SUBJECT PROFILE: A-03</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Naomi (Last Name: [REDACTED])</p>
  <p><strong>Age:</strong> 15</p>
  <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Domestic Sector B-22</p>
  <p><strong>Initial Intake Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p>

  <h2>Background Summary</h2>
  <p>Subject A-03 was placed under care of Project Forget Me following prolonged exposure to domestic abuse and emotional neglect. Subject displays signs of anxiety, memory fragmentation, and frequent dissociative episodes. Subject was originally believed to have familial support; however, evidence indicates abandonment under false pretenses.</p>

  <p>Subject reports presence of a cousin named “Janet,” unverified by project records. Temporal inconsistencies in subject’s recollections suggest artificial manipulation of environmental and psychological stimuli.</p>

  <h2>Experiment Purpose</h2>
  <p>Subject is utilized to assess efficacy of controlled memory erasure combined with environmental isolation. Subject’s responses to staged sensory anomalies and induced forgetfulness are continuously monitored. Experiment aims to develop protocols for behavioral reconditioning and controlled social interaction under isolation conditions.</p>

  <h2>Notable Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recurrent memory lapses lasting 4-7 hours</li>
    <li>Vocal self-dialogue recorded during dissociative states</li>
    <li>Unexplained written notes and symbols appearing in personal effects</li>
    <li>Erratic emotional fluctuations including anxiety and depressive episodes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Status:</h2>
  <p><em>ACTIVE – Under intensified memory suppression protocol</em></p>
