    <div class="note-title">Dr. Everson — [PRIVATE THOUGHT LOG]</div>
    I see her sometimes. Staring at corners.  
    She's not supposed to remember. But her drawings… they match the original lab.  
    Janet isn't in the system — why is Naomi asking about her again?
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">AUTOSAVE — FILE UNKNOWN</div>
    Subject A-03 recorded vocal sample at 02:12 AM:  
    “Why did Daddy leave me in the pink room again?”  
    <span class="glitch">This file should have been erased.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Security Team Lead</div>
    Door 3A opened on its own. No log, no footage.  
    Naomi’s door code wasn’t activated, but she was inside.  
    We need a hard lockdown. Someone’s manipulating the timeline again.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">Deleted Draft — Not Sent</div>
    I miss her voice before it got so quiet.  
    Sometimes I hear her whisper in the vents.  
    Maybe she never forgot. Maybe she’s just pretending to play along.  
    <span class="hidden">I deserve what’s coming.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <div class="note-title">System Admin Log — Unclassified</div>
    WARNING: Subject A-03's dream logs syncing with offline files.  
    Experiment runtime exceeds 365 days. She still believes it’s Month 5.  
    No human can endure this. Not even her.
